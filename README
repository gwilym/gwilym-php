Note: This is largely incomplete and obsolete, it's mainly here for posterity as some proprietary code was spawned from these beginnings. Code which may later be open sourced.

this should be able to be dropped anywhere and just start working though you may need to do the following (assuming apache):

- rename "htaccess.example" to .htaccess
- adjust RewriteBase in .htaccess to suit your setup
- create directory /app/var/ and make it writable
